# StockSMSResponseSystem

To build on my StockScraper alert system, I implemented functionality that allows the user to control the script using text messages. Throughout the process I familiarized 
myself with two popular VoIP/SMSoIP, Twilio and Plivo. This program allows the user to add stocks to their alert list, start or stop the alert system, and check the 
price of any stock by simply sending a text message. The system replies with confirmation or the user if they entered something incorrectly. 



Twilio vs Plivo
Twilio seems to be more user friendly and the libraries for the API are much cleaner.
Plivo
